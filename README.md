## How to test
If you run the code, then you will be asked to enter the topic.\
Enter "Arithmetic" for arithmetic and then input whatever you want to calculate. For example, 5 + 3. or more can be calculated.\
Enter "Trigonometry" for trig. In order to input a trig function(radians), put in "trigfunc x", where x can be anything. So, "sin 4" would return 0.7568024953...Enter functions in their short form, i.e, sin, cos, tan, csc, sec, cot. Input as how I quoted. Everything is in radians.\
Enter "Logarithms" for log values. You will be asked to enter your base and then your argument. So a base of 2 and an argument of 4 equates to log(base-2) of 4, which should return 2.0.\
Enter "Factorial" for factorial values. You will be asked to enter your number. It will then return the factorial to you. The acceptable range for the number n is 0 <= n <= 170.\
Enter "Combination" for the combination of n and k. You will be asked to input your n value and then your k value. So inputing 5 and 3 for n and k, respectively, gives us 5C3, which is 10.\
Enter "Permutation" for the permutation of n and k. You will be asked to inout your n value and then your k value. So inputing 8 and 5 for n and k, respectively, gives is 8P5, which is 6720.
#### Notes
This is still a progress in work and is under constant improvement. There will be more topics added soon. There will also be a few errors, which I will look over and try my best to resolve...
